# Flutter-LessUI

This is a school project that I built as part of a UX class. Its not a polished or finished product,
but the general functionality I was shooting for is there.

Using a Raspberrypi attached to a Local Area Network, listening for DHCP packets, notifications are
pushed to devices on the network when a device connects to the network. Users can choose to ignore
that device in the future or opt in to be notified when that device connects.
